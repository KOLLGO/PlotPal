# PlotPal
A fun party game mobile app for blindly writing a story with your friends.

# Brief Explaination of the App's Concept
In PlotPal, you write a Story with your Friends. The Twist is: nobody knows the plot!
Before starting the game, add all players and determine the number of turns (1 turn = every player typed a sentence).
One player will add a sentence to your story. As the device is passed around, all the previous sentences are censored and every player will only see the sentence typed by the player before them.
The more friends, the more fun and confusion!

You may stop any time, regardless of your selected turn count. As the game stops, all the sentences are revealed. You may also save the story as a txt file.

# Installation
For installing PlotPal on your Android device, go to the [builds](https://github.com/KOLLGO/PlotPal/tree/main/builds) folder. You can find the versions I already built there (`APK` or `AAB`). You may also clone this repo and build it all on your own, I recommend using the pre-built versions. Once you got the `apk` or `aab` file on your phone, install it as usually done with these files.

I haven't built an IOS version for this project, but it is possible with the code. You will have to build that on your own.
